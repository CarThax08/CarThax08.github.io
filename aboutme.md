My name is Carson Thackston but I am more commonly known as CarThax08 or CarMan08

- I am currently a highschool student who develops spigot plugins for fun.
- I am open for any form of request that you have and you can ask me any questions.

What else do you need?

### My story
I constantly tried to start my own minecraft servers using free and public plugins, but once I realized how boring that is and how bad some of those plugins can be, I decided to learn java development. I started off small, just making projects for my friends whenever they needed, but I eventually got confident enough to release my first plugin publicly on spigot.
